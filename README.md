Reward-point-calculator. This project calculates the reward points for single and multiple customers based on the customer transaction.

This project calculates the reward points for single and multiple customers based on the customer transaction amount.

If the customer does the transaction is greater than 100$, then the reward point is 2 for each dollar the customer spent. The reward point is 1 for the transaction amount between the range 50-100$. There is no reward point for a transaction less than 
50
. Here, the DB is used to store and calculate the total reward points, monthly summation of reward points, and 3-month reward point summation. Here I used MySQL db.

The tables to be created in MySQL DB are

Customer

Transaction

The relationship between the customer and the Transaction is One-To-many. Here Customer ID is used as a foreign key in the Transaction table. Whenever a new transaction is made, the reward point is calculated and stored in the database along with the customer transaction data.
